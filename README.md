## About

The task was to build a replica of a news page ( a png was provided).

I used Vite as my tool to build this project as it is a tool I am familiar with and have used for several projects.

CSS was used for styling.

Thank you for the opportunity to showcase to you my work!

- Please note: It seems the story about "Oil giant Shell..." was not in the data, so I replaced this story with the extra story property that was provided.
